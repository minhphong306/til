Embracing Entrepreneurship: Why I Won't Retire at 30
Retirement is a concept that has been ingrained in our society as the ultimate goal for years of hard work. Many people dream of retiring early, savoring a life of leisure and relaxation. However, I have a different plan in mind. I don't intend to retire at 30; instead, I'm gearing up to start a new chapter in my life as an entrepreneur when I turn 32, and I have a compelling reason for this decision - my child.

The Traditional Retirement Dream
For decades, the traditional retirement age has been set at around 65. People work tirelessly throughout their lives, diligently saving money in the hopes of enjoying their golden years in peace. The idea of retiring early, perhaps in their 40s or 50s, is seen as a rare luxury only achievable by the financially fortunate.

A Different Path
My perspective on retirement took a significant shift when I became a parent. Suddenly, my priorities changed, and my definition of success evolved. While I still value financial security and the freedom to pursue my passions, I realize that true wealth lies in spending time with my child, watching them grow, and actively participating in their life.

Entrepreneurship as a Solution
To achieve this vision, I've decided to embark on an entrepreneurial journey. Starting my own business not only allows me to have control over my time but also enables me to build a legacy that I can pass on to my child. While entrepreneurship comes with its own set of challenges and uncertainties, I believe that the potential rewards far outweigh the risks.

Why Wait Until 32?
You might wonder why I've chosen to start my entrepreneurial venture at 32, rather than immediately. The answer lies in responsible planning. I want to ensure that I have a solid financial foundation to support my family and my business. This extra time will allow me to gain valuable experience, save more money, and thoroughly prepare for the challenges of entrepreneurship.

The Joy of Balancing Work and Family
I'm not shunning the idea of hard work or ambition; instead, I'm embracing a balanced approach to life. By starting my business when I'm 32, I aim to strike a harmonious balance between pursuing my career dreams and cherishing the moments with my child. I want to be present for their important milestones and provide them with the support and guidance they need.

In Conclusion
Retirement doesn't have to be a one-size-fits-all concept. While some may choose to retire early and enjoy a life of leisure, others, like myself, may find fulfillment in entrepreneurship and a balanced life with their family. The key is to follow your heart and define your own path to happiness and success.

So, do I plan to retire after 30? No, I plan to embark on an exciting entrepreneurial journey at 32, driven by the desire to create a better future for my child and myself. After all, it's not about the age at which we retire; it's about the life we choose to live.
