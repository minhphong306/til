Jonny Miller is the founder of Nervous System Mastery, a course that has helped hundreds of founders and tech leaders cultivate calm, reduce nervousness, enhance resilience, and elevate their sense of aliveness. Having personally benefited from Jonny’s teachings, I’m especially excited to have him on the show. In this episode, we discuss:
• How shifting your focus from the mind to the body can help ease nervousness
• The power of breath in changing states
• The importance of “interoception”
• Specific breathing exercises to both calm and excite your nervous system
• The A.P.E. (awareness, posture, and emotion) framework for recognizing body signals
• The “feather, brick, dump truck” phenomenon
• The concept of emotional debt and how to release it
• The competitive advantage of feeling emotions

Jonny’s five-week boot camp, Nervous System Mastery, will equip you with evidence-backed protocols to cultivate greater calm and agency over your internal state. Learn to rewire maladaptive stress responses and improve your sleep (use code LENNY for $250 discount). Apply here.

Some takeaways:

To alleviate nervousness and anxiety, use a “bottom-up” approach, including techniques such as controlled breathing, to influence the body’s physiology. By focusing on physiological changes first, a positive cascade effect can impact thoughts and feelings.

To calm your nervous system, breathe into your stomach and ensure that the exhale is twice as long as the inhale. One example is to inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your nose for eight counts. In doing so, you activate the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a calming effect on the body and mind.

Humming can further enhance the calming effect. After the deep breathing exercises, try humming through your nose during the exhale. This not only aids in relaxation but also has potential benefits like releasing nitric oxide and reducing eye tension.

To excite your nervous system, breathe into your upper chest in a shallow and rapid manner. In doing so, you activate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in adrenaline and cortisol.

Interoception, described as the sixth sense, is our ability to sense and feel our internal landscape, including aspects like breath, tension, moods, and emotions. Similar to training your flavor palate as a chef, you can train your interoceptive palate to become more aware of internal sensations. By doing so, you increase your ability to notice early warning signs of stress or anxiety. The key is to catch subtle changes in your body early on and engage in practices that help manage stress before it escalates. This heightened self-awareness can lead to better decision-making and improved overall well-being.

It’s much harder to execute calming techniques without practice, especially in challenging moments when you need it most. You can ensure your tools are sharp and ready by practicing breathwork or somatics for 10 to 15 minutes each day for a week.

We all need to improve our ability to recognize early signs of burnout. Emotional debt accumulates gradually and, if left unaddressed, can eventually lead to a health crisis. The earlier you become aware of how and why you are accruing emotional debt, the sooner you can start managing it and prevent burnout.
